                Hello, thank you and welcome to [insert product name here], your very own primer to AI and proper use of
                AI. In this
                interactive course we will be going over common misconceptions about artificial intelligence, large
                language models,
                and generative models as well as some pointers on how to utilize such software for whatever task you
                need. <br>
                Module 1: Introduction to AI <br>
                In this module we will be going over what AI is and responsible use of AI. <br>
                What is an AI? <br>
                AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is a broad umbrella term referring to the many ways software
                can mimic intelligence.
                There are two types of AI, narrow AI and general AI, sometimes called general intelligence. <br>
                Narrow AI is AI made for resolving a specific task or set of tasks and is not capable of adapting and
                solving any problem, meanwhile
                general AI can adapt to solve any problem put before it. The AI we have now, from image generation to
                chat bots to spell check
                are all narrow AI. <br>
                Today I want to talk to you about a specific type of narrow AI, LLMs, or large language models. <br>
                LLMs: Large Language Models <br>
                Large language models, aka LLMs, are text prediction algorithms that train itself on what output is most
                likely to occur for a specific
                text input. <br>
                This is like the spell check found on our very own phones, but through a more complex and comprehensive
                model we can predict more
                than just a single word. <br>
                LLMs, truth, and training data <br>
                Large language models are incapable of understanding the concepts of the words it predicts as it is.
                Such models can only predict the
                most likely words to follow based off its training data and will inherit flaws from that training data.
                <br>
                Because of this behavior, large language models and other models that rely on large neural networks can
                not react or predict items
                outside its training data.” <br>
                Bees and Buses <br>
                Take for instance a neural network algorithm that sorts images into either the category of bee or bus.
                This algorithm has been trained
                under the assumption that all images are either bees or buses. When given an image of say a banana, this
                algorithm may predict, with
                high confidence, that the picture is of a bus, despite its lack of resemblance to the large metal
                traveler. The way these algorithms are
                trained will greatly affect the outcome of the results in ways we may not realize right away. <br>
                What hidden assumptions are going into the models that you use? <br>
                Responsible Use <br>
                It’s important to be able to understand what to give and what to take from AI to be a responsible
                developer. As a developer it is your
                duty to ensure any code that you do rely on LLMs for, whether for reference or more, is code that you
                can trust. <br>
                Generated code can contain flaws that you didn’t know about and it’s important to be aware of that, from
                smaller formatting errors to
                larger security flaws. <br>
                Some of the security flaws that can arise from using large language models include: <br>
                -Injection vulnerabilities from using outdated libraries, deprecated functions, or merely lacking input
                sanitization <br>
                -Allowing vulnerable memory through the use of cstrings <br>
                -Having vulnerable data hardcoded in the code itself <br>
                Amongst other things. <br>
                You should always check the output of a large language model before using it, be aware of modern and
                legacy vulnerabilities with the
                stack you are using, and avoid providing sensitive tokens, keys, or company code to untrusted models.
                <br>
                Whenever in doubt of what you can do, refer to your company’s policy on AI usage and ask your employer
                if the information provided is unclear. <br>
                Summary <br>
                In this module we talked about what AI is, what large language models are, and how they work. We also
                talked about how to responsibly use large
                language models and some of the things to be aware of using AI.
