                        <b>Module 1: Introduction to AI</b> <br>
                        Hello, thank you and welcome to llmDevGuide, your very own primer to AI and proper
                        use of
                        AI. In this
                        interactive course we will be going over common misconceptions about artificial intelligence,
                        large
                        language models,
                        and generative models as well as some pointers on how to utilize such software for whatever task
                        you
                        need.<br>
                        <b>Overview of Module</b> <br>
                        In this module we will be going over what AI is and responsible use of AI. <br>
                        <b>A.I.</b> <br>
                        AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is a broad umbrella term referring to the many ways
                        software
                        can mimic intelligence.
                        There are two types of AI, narrow AI and general AI, sometimes called general intelligence. <br>
                        <b>Narrow vs. General AI</b> <br>
                        Narrow AI is AI made for resolving a specific task or set of tasks and is not capable of
                        adapting
                        and
                        solving any problem, meanwhile
                        general AI can adapt to solve any problem put before it. The AI we have now, from image
                        generation
                        to
                        chat bots to spell check
                        are all narrow AI. <br>
                        <b>Narrow AI: LLMs</b> <br>
                        Today I want to talk to you about a specific type of narrow AI, LLMs, or large language models.
                        <br>
                        <b>Large Language Models</b> <br>
                        Large language models, aka LLMs, are text prediction algorithms that train itself on what output
                        is
                        most
                        likely to occur for a specific
                        text input. <br>
                        This is like the spell check found on our very own phones, but through a more complex and
                        comprehensive
                        model we can predict more
                        than just a single word. <br>
                        <b>Limitation of LLMs</b> <br>
                        Large language models are incapable of understanding the concepts of the words it predicts as it
                        is.
                        Such models can only predict the
                        most likely words to follow based off its training data and will inherit flaws from that
                        training
                        data.
                        <br>
                        Because of this behavior, large language models and other models that rely on large neural
                        networks
                        can
                        not react or predict items
                        outside its training data.” <br>
                        <b>Bees v Buses example</b> <br>
                        Take for instance a neural network algorithm that sorts images into either the category of bee
                        or
                        bus.
                        This algorithm has been trained
                        under the assumption that all images are either bees or buses. When given an image of say a
                        banana,
                        this
                        algorithm may predict, with
                        high confidence, that the picture is of a bus, despite its lack of resemblance to the large
                        metal
                        traveler. The way these algorithms are
                        trained will greatly affect the outcome of the results in ways we may not realize right away.
                        <br>
                        What hidden assumptions are going into the models that you use? <br>
                        <b>Duties as a Dev</b> <br>
                        It’s important to be able to understand what to give and what to take from AI to be a
                        responsible
                        developer. As a developer it is your
                        duty to ensure any code that you do rely on LLMs for, whether for reference or more, is code
                        that
                        you
                        can trust. <br>
                        Generated code can contain flaws that you didn’t know about and it’s important to be aware of
                        that,
                        from
                        smaller formatting errors to
                        larger security flaws. <br>
                        <b>Security Flaws: Part 1</b> <br>
                        Some of the security flaws that can arise from using large language models include: <br>
                        -Injection vulnerabilities from using outdated libraries, deprecated functions, or merely
                        lacking
                        input
                        sanitization <br>
                        <b>Security Flaws: Part 2</b> <br>
                        -Allowing vulnerable memory through the use of cstrings <br>
                        -Having vulnerable data hardcoded in the code itself <br>
                        Amongst other things. <br>
                        <b>Your Responsabilities</b> <br>
                        You should always check the output of a large language model before using it, be aware of modern
                        and
                        legacy vulnerabilities with the
                        stack you are using, and avoid providing sensitive tokens, keys, or company code to untrusted
                        models.
                        <br>
                        Whenever in doubt of what you can do, refer to your company’s policy on AI usage and ask your
                        employer
                        if the information provided is unclear. <br>
                        <b>In Summary</b> <br>
                        In this module we talked about what AI is, what large language models are, and how they work. We
                        also
                        talked about how to responsibly use large
                        language models and some of the things to be aware of using AI.
